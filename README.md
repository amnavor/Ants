# Ants
Synopsis
-------------
The Ants game is a play on PopCap's Plants vs. Zombies. Here, you are using
different types of Ants with unique offensive and defensive moves to fend
off invading bees and protect the Queen Ant. For example, the throwerAnt
throws leaves at bees to decrease their armor, and the bodyGuardAnt protects
other ants. The player needs to collect food to add more ants, and also has
to be wary of different power-ups and specific environments. For example, only
the 'watersafe' insects can be in the Water place. More information is 
available in Antzzz.py
